<p>Content Creation is one of the main functions of the Process Lab. Content creation is based on sections defined in the templates created in the Administrative Area. Content may contain text, links and images/files in each section. Content may be published for other users to view. But remains private to the author until it is published. There is an area for users to provide feedback to content (formative review). Content may be reviewed and scored according to the competencies defined in the template (summative review). Content may be edited by going to the “Work in Progress” tab in the dashboard and clicking on the “edit” button. Content may also be deleted under the “Work in Progress” tab by clicking on the “delete” button.</p>

<h4>Build</h4>
<p>At the top of each dashboard is a button labeled “Build”. This is the starting point for creating content. Upon landing on the Build page, users are given a choice of templates to get started. Clicking on a template will provide a new layout for the user with navigation elements on the left and a working space on the right. To begin the user can add a Title to name the content and create the work in progress. If the template is associated with a course and/or aligned with a rubric, links will be available to access each of these.</p>

<h4>Title</h4>
<p>A Title is required to create content and all titles must be unique per user. A title may be edited later by clicking on the title in the left navigation.</p>

<h4>Sections and Fields</h4>

<p>Sections and fields are defined and titled in the template. Users may navigate to each section by selecting the section title underneath “Build” in the left navigation. Each section may have many fields. Within each field a user may add text, websites and images or files. If a field is marked as required, one of these options must be supplied.</p>

<p>Within each section a user may request feedback. In the upper right corner of each section is a “Share” slider. Clicking on the slider will turn on the feedback request for that section.</p>


<ul>
<li><h5>Text</h5>

Within each text field, a user may add content. The text editor allows the user to change font sizes, add styling, format text, and add links to other content.</li>


<li><h5>Links</h5>

Multiple links may be added for each field. Each link must begin with http:// or https://. Links may be edited or removed once added by clicking on the remove link to the right of the link.</li>

<li><h5>Images/Files</h5>

Images or files may be uploaded to each field by either dragging and dropping the file or clicking on the box with the dashed border. File types allowed are: .jpg/.jpeg, .gif, .png, .pdf, .doc, .docx. Once a file is uploaded, it will appear as a thumbnail beneath the box. Clicking on a thumbnail will reveal an enlarged version of the image. If the file is not an image but a pdf or doc, the file will be downloadable by clicking on it. Images and files may be removed by clicking on the “x” to the left of the thumbnail.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tag</h4>

<p>Tags are used to help users search for and find content. To add tags for content, click on “Tag” in the left navigation. Begin by typing in the “Add new tag” box. As a user types, tags that have already been entered will appear. The user should select the tag that most closely matches the tag that describes their content or they may continue typing to create a new tag and then click enter to add. Tags will appear below to the left of the box and can be removed by clicking on the “x” to the right of the tag.</p>

<h4>Notes from the field</h4>

<p>The Notes from the field area is a place for users to write notes and observations to help them create their content. Just like the text editor in each the section fields, users may format and style the text.</p>
