<p>The Process Lab is a content creation system with features that allow for collaborative and summative feedback. It provides a template system to accommodate unique content types. Content may be aligned to competency frameworks and rubrics providing guidelines for authors, feedback, and reviews. Content may be published and searched. The status report API may be used to connect to other systems which may calculate this data and issue credentials such as Open Badges.</p>
