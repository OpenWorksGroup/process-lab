The process lab has several roles. These roles may be assigned in the administrative area or via LTI. The permissions for these roles are as follows:

* admin - The admin has permissions to do anything. There can be more than one admin. The admin has access to the Admin Dashboard.
* author - This is the default role for all users. Authors have access to their own dashboard, can create and publish content, and can provide collaborative feedback on other content.
* expert & peer reviewer - For the time being these roles have the same permissions. There are two separate roles for reviewers to expand upon the review process later on. These users get notifications on their dashboards when content has been submitted for a review by the author.
* online facilitator - This role is not in use yet but is intended to provide facilitation for collaborative reviews.
