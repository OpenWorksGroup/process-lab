There are two main dashboards. One for Administrators (Admin Dashboard) and one for other users (dashboard).

<h4>Administrator</h4>
The Admin Dashboard is the landing page for admins. It is the portal for the Administrative Area. Only those assigned to the admin role have access to this dashboard.

<h4>Other Users</h4>
All other users (including the admins) have access to the standard dashboard. Here users will find:
<ul>
<li>Published Content (Can search by title, author and tags)</li>
<li>My Published Content - Their own published content (Can view, see reviews & delete)</li>
<li>Work in Progress - Their work in progress (Can view, edit, see reviews & delete)</li>
<li>Feedback Needed - Feedback requested from other users (Add feedback)</li>
<li>Reviews Requested - Visible only to those who are expert or peer reviewers. Displays a list of content requesting reviews.</li>
</ul>

The “Build” button takes users to a page where they can select a template and start building their content.
