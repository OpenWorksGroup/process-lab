weight: 9
---

<p>Unlike formative feedback, reviews are intended to provide a summative assessment of the content according to the rubric defined in the template. If a rubric is not defined in the template, reviews are not available for the content.</p>

<p>To request a review, a user should click on the “edit” button in the “Work in Progress” tab in the user dashboard. At the bottom of the left navigation, is a “Submit for Review” button. Upon clicking the button, all required fields will be checked. If all requirements are met, the content will be submitted for a review. Otherwise, the user will be notified of which sections still need to be completed.</p>

<p>Requested reviews are accessible in the “Reviews Requested” tab for those who have been assigned the roles expert or peer reviewer. Requested reviews will be displayed until 3 reviews have been completed for the content. Users may not review their own content. Upon clicking the “review” button, reviewers will be shown the content submitted, a link to view the rubric, and all collaborative feedback. The reviewer will be supplied with a section of radio buttons each aligned to the rubric and scoring. Each competency is required. The reviewer must also provide a comment for the author. Scores are saved and are accessible via the Status Report API. Users may also view the reviews under the “My Published Content” tab.</p>
